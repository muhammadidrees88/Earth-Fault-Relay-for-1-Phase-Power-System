# Earth-Fault-Relay-in-1-Phase-Power-System
Objective of this project is to design and construct of an earth-fault relay which will detect
instantaneous earth fault or line-to-ground fault which is vital domestically and industrially
where earth-fault monitoring or power loss avoid system is required in an electrical
installation.
Earth Fault Relay has the following Features;
1) Domestic earth fault monitoring.
2) Single phase industrial protection.
3) Avoids power loss.
4) Avoids unnecessary tariff.
